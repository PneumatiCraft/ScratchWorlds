ScratchWorlds is a CraftBukkit plugin for Minecraft 1.6+ to allow players to create "scratch" worlds, or temporary areas that are regenerated regularly.

## Building

In order to build ScratchWorlds, you will need Ant 1.6 or newer, as well as a compatible JDK on your system (Sun JDK 1.5 or newer is preferred). Simply run `ant jar` and watch as ScratchWorlds builds itself. (The latest CraftBukkit and Permissions 3.1.5b will fetch themselves.)
