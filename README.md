ScratchWorlds is a CraftBukkit plugin for Minecraft 1.6+ to allow players to create "scratch" worlds, or temporary areas that are regenerated regularly.

## Building

In order to build ScratchWorlds, you will need Ant 1.6 or newer, as well as a compatible JDK on your system (Sun JDK 1.5 or newer is preferred). Do the following:

1. Make a new directory called `lib` in the root of the ScratchWorlds repository.
2. Download both the latest CraftBukkit and Permissions jars into the `lib` folder. Name them `craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` and `Permissions.jar` respectively.
3. In the root of the repo, run `ant` (or `ant jar` if you're feeling verbose).

You now have the latest committed version of the ScratchWorlds JAR!
